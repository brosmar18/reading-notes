# Project Ideas 

## Real-Time Quiz Game Platform

**Concept:**
- A quiz game where participants join as clients to answer questions in real-time.
- The hub server sends quiz questions and collects responses.
- Features real-time updates of scores and leaderboards.

**Key Features:**
- **Hub Server:** Manages quiz events, question distribution, and scoring.
- **Client Interaction:** Players receive questions and submit answers, with real-time score updates.
- **Network Operation:** Works over a network for wide participation.
- **Optional API Integration:** Fetch quiz questions from a database; store game results.
- **Queue Systems:** Standard and FIFO queues manage questions and answers for fair gameplay.

**Presentation Aspects:**
- Live quiz session with participants.
- Network setup and event-driven architecture explanation.
- Code review on event handling and client-server interaction.

## Collaborative Project Management Tool

**Concept:**
- A tool for teams to collaborate on and track project tasks in real-time.
- Team members update task status; the hub updates the project board.
- Includes notifications, task assignments, and progress tracking.

**Key Features:**
- **Hub Server:** Handles task updates, project timelines, and communications.
- **Client Interaction:** Team members update tasks and receive project notifications.
- **Network Operation:** Facilitates remote collaboration over the internet.
- **Optional API Integration:** Database integration for project data and task histories.
- **Queue Systems:** Standard and FIFO queues for task updates and notifications.

**Presentation Aspects:**
- Demonstration of collaborative project management.
- Real-time task and timeline updates.
- Code review focused on event-driven updates and network communication.

## Things I Want to Know More About

In the context of developing event-driven applications, I want to explore more about the optimal ways to handle high-volume event traffic, ensuring robust and efficient data transmission over the network. Additionally, I am curious about the best practices for integrating APIs and databases in such a setup, particularly how to effectively use standard and FIFO queues for managing event flow and data consistency.
