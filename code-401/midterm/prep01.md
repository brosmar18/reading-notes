# Mideterm Prep #1

## Cooperation Plan 

- **What are the key strengths of each person on the team?**

    My primary strengths within the team center on organization, time management, and prioritization, skills that are crucial for keeping the project on track and efficiently managed. Additionally, my proficiency in backend development, which has significantly grown throughout this program, will be a key asset. I plan to leverage this skill set to ensure robust an efficient backend solutions for the project, demonstrating how these technical and managerial abilities can synergistically contribute to a team's success. 

- **How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?**

    To best utilize my strengths in the execution of the project, I will concentrate on planning, aligning the project timeline and key deliverables and essential features. This approach will prevent over-complication, ensuring that the project remains focused and aligned with the assignment's objectives. I intend to establish daily milestones and priorities over functionalities, creating a structured and efficient workflow. Additionally, should time permit, I have planned supplementary features that can be integrated, allowing for scalability and enhancement of the project without detracting from the primary goals. This balanced strategy will ensure that my organizational and backend development skills are optimally employed.

- **In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?**

    My goal is to enhance my proficiency in the design aspects of application development, particularly in UI/UX and frontend development. Although our current project is backend-centric with no user interface, I aim to architect the backend with a forward-thinking approach, considering potential UI/UX designs. This mindset will ensure that our backend infrastructure is not only robust but also intuitively aligned with future user interface requirements. By doing so, I intend to create a seamless integration path for an enhanced user experience, bridging my current strengths with areas I aspire to develop further.

- **Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?**

    To ensure every team member is aligned and informed about all aspects of the project, I would implement structured daily check-in meetings. Each morning, we'll have a meeting to set the day's goals and priorities, providing clarity and focus for the team's efforts. This will be complemented by a mid-day check-in to assess progress, address any challenges, and offer assistance if needed. Additionally, our morning meetings will include a review of the previous day's objectives to evaluate progress and make necessary adjustments. This approach not only fosters team collaboration and support but also ensures continuous and comprehensive understanding of the project among all team members.
