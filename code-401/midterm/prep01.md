    The group's strategy for resolving conflict hinges on clear and consistent communication. For conflicts related to the application's development, we will refer back to the pre-established goals of the project as a guiding framework for resolution. This ensures that any disagreements are addressed in the context of what best serves the project's objectives. In cases of interpersonal conflicts among team members, open dialogue will be encouraged, with the provision for escalation to a team leader or manager if necessary. Additionally, our practice of daily meetings will play a pivotal role in preemptively mitigating conflicts. These regular updates will keep everyone informed about the app's status and goals, fostering a shared understanding and minimizing the potential for misunderstandings or conflicts.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

    In the event that one team member begins to dominate the project, the team will address the issue through a collaborative and structured approach. First, we would openly discuss the situation in a constructive and non-confrontational manner, ensuring that all voices are heard and respected. This will emphasize the importance of balanced participation and the value of diverse perspectives in the success of the project. Additionally, we would revisit and possibly revise the project roles and responsibilities to ensure equitable distribution of tasks. If necessary, we would seek guidance from a supervisor or in this case, the instructor, to facilitate the process. The goal is to foster an inclusive environment where every team member feels valued and has the opportunity to contribute effectively.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

    Acknowledging the varying levels of understanding and skill within a team, we would plan to approach the project with a strategy tailored to leverage individual strengths. Task assignments will be strategically aligned with each member's specific skills and competencies, ensuring efficiency and quality in our work. Our daily mid-day check-ins will serve as a vital platform to assess progress, identify areas where team members may need support, and allocate assistance accordingly. This process not only facilitates skill development but also ensures no one is left behind.

If such a situation arises, we will initiate a respectful and constructive conversation with the concerned member to understand the underlying reasons for their delay, be it personal challenges, misunderstandings of the task, or a need for additional resources or support. Our aim will be to collaboratively find a solution that enables them to contribute more effectively. However, if despite these efforts, the issue persists and significantly impacts the project, we will escalate the matter to our instructor or supervisor for further guidance and appropriate action. This balanced approach ensures that we address the issue with empathy while maintaining the project's progress and team dynamics.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

    The approach is an emphasis on internal resolution as teh first course of action. The daily meetings and check-ins are designed to promptly identify and address any conflicts or challenges that arise, fostering an environment of open communication and collaboration. We believe that most issues can be resolved through effective team dialogue and mutual understanding. However, in cases where our resolution attempts are unsuccessful, and it becomes evident that internal collaboration is insufficient, we will not hesitate to escalate the matter to an appropriate authority figure, such as a project supervisor or instructor. This escalation will be done in a timely manner to ensure that the conflict does not hinder the project's progress or team dynamics. Our priority is to maintain a productive and harmonious team environment, and we are committed to taking the necessary steps to achieve this, including seeking external intervention when needed.

## Communication Plan

    I will be readily available for communication during standard working hours, from 8 AM to 5 PM. Additionally, while my primary work focus will be within these hours, I will also make a point to periodically check my email in the evenings. This approach ensures that I can promptly respond to any urgent matters that may arise outside of regular working hours.

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

    For work-related communication, the primary platforms will be Slack and email. Slack will serve as the go-to channel for real-time discussions and quick updates, while email will be used for more formal communications and detailed information sharing. This dual-platform approach ensures both immediacy and thoroughness in a team's communication.

- How often will you take breaks?

    The Pomodoro technique for managing a workday has been a beneficial technique for time management and productivity. This involves a 25-minute focused work session followed y 5-minute breaks with a longer 15-min break every two hours. In a developer's role where prolonged sitting is common, I find that frequent breaks to stand, stretch, and walk around are crucial. This routine not only boosts productivity but also encourages healthy habits, balancing intense focus with necessary physical activity. 

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

    If I start to fall behind, my immediate action will be to reassess and prioritize tasks based on the project's core objectives. This involves identifying which features or aspects are most critical and refocusing my efforts accordingly. I would also communicate any changes or challenges with the team to ensure the collective plan is updated and remains aligned with the goals. This approach allows for adaptive and responsive project management, ensuring that essential tasks are prioritized and completed efficiently.

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

    For after-hours and weekend communications, I will continue to use Slack and email. This approach maintains consistency in the communication channels while respecting the balance between work and personal time.

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

    To ensure that every team member's voice is heard, the strategy revolves around structured daily meetings and check-ins. In these sessions, we would systematically go around the group, giving each person an opportunity to speak about their progress, any challenges faced, and any other relevant insights or ideas they wish to share. This approach guarantees that all team members have an equal platform to express themselves, fostering an inclusive and collaborative environment.

- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

    To create a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up, the team leader will play a pivotal role in fostering a respectful and inclusive atmosphere. This includes ensuring that each team member gets an uninterrupted chance to speak and share their views. In the event of conflicts, maintaining a respectful and non-confrontational tone will be emphasized. By upholding these principles, we aim to cultivate an environment where open communication and mutual respect are the norm, encouraging all team members to contribute freely and confidently.

## Work Plan 

- How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

    The process of task management in our project will start with identifying the essential features of the app. Each feature will then be broken down into smaller, manageable components, with each component representing a specific task. These tasks would be assigned to team members based on their individual strengths and skills, ensuring efficiency and quality in execution. We would use project management tools to track the progress and completion of these tasks, facilitating clear visibility and effective coordination of work across the team. This structured approach allows us to efficiently manage workload and ensure timely completion of each component of the project.

## Git Process

- What components of your project will live on GitHub?

    All components of the project, including the complete codebase, will be hosted on GitHub. This encompasses not only the source code but also any related documentation and resources. Additionally, if applicable, I will provide a link to the deployed application directly within the repository. A comprehensive README.md file will also be included, detailing the application's purpose, functionality, and instructions for use. This approach ensures that GitHub serves as a central hub for all project-related materials, facilitating easy access, collaboration, and transparency for an entire team.

- How will you share the repository with your teammates?

    To share the repository with teammates, a single central repository will be created on GitHub. Each team member will be able to fork this repository to their personal accounts for individual work. Furthermore, all team members would be added as collaborators on the main project repository. This setup will enable them to create pull requests, which the team can then review collectively. This approach ensures a streamlined workflow where everyone has access to the latest codebase and can contribute effectively while maintaining a coherent version control system.

- What is your Git flow?

    The Git flow involves a two-tier branching structure for efficient and organized development. Initially, all team members would merge their individual pull requests into a development branch, which serves as our primary integration branch. This development branch will be a dynamic space where we can collectively test and ensure that new features, fixes, and updates work harmoniously together. Once we confirm that the development branch is stable and functioning correctly with everyone's contributions, it will then be merged into the main branch. The main branch represents the project's most stable and updated version, ready for final deployment or delivery. This workflow allows for continuous integration and testing while maintaining the integrity of our main codebase.

- Will you be using a PR review workflow? 

    Yes, we would be implementing a PR (Pull Request) review workflow. Pull requests submitted by team members would be collectively reviewed during team meetings. This process allows each member to explain their contributions and facilitates a thorough understanding of the changes being made. Additionally, it provides an opportunity for the team to collaboratively address any merging errors or conflicts that arise, ensuring that all integrations into the codebase are seamless and well-coordinated. This collaborative review approach not only enhances code quality but also fosters team cohesion and mutual learning.
