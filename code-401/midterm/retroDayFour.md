# Retro 04

## Progress

Today marked a significant organizational improvement in my project, with a focus on code refinement and documentation. I successfully restructured the backend code for better separation of concerns and comprehensively documented the project. Additionally, I completed the project presentation, encapsulating the entire journey and key aspects of the application.

## Contributions

- **Code Organization**: Achieved a cleaner and more maintainable codebase by separating Socket.io and Express logic. Moved all Socket.io related logic to `/socket.js/`, maintaining a clear distinction from the Express logic in `/server.js/`. This separation enhances the readability and manageability of the code.

- **Documentation**: Drafted a detailed `README.md` file for the project, covering essential aspects such as:

    - Problem Domain
    - Links and Resources 
    - Collaborations
    - Set Up 
    - Features
    - Running Tests
    - Incomplete or Skipped Tests
    
    This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to understand or contribute to the project.

- **Project Presentation**: Completed a PowerPoint presentation to showcase the project. This presentation includes:

    - Slide 1: Team Name and Logo
    - Slide 2: Summary of the Project
    - Individual Slides for Each Team Member: Featuring a picture, personal introduction, role in the team, and a personal pitch
    - Slide: Detailed discussion of the Problem Domain 
    - Slide: Presentation of our Solution
    - Demonstration of the Working Application
    - Slide: Display of our Tests
    - Slide: Overview of our Workflow and Process 
    - Slide: Highlights of our Wins and Areas for Growth
    - A Q&A Session

## Challenges

The primary challenge today revolved around time management and prioritizing tasks in a self-paced environment. The temptation to continuously add features to the application was strong, but I focused on solidifying and refining the existing features. This approach ensured a robust, well-documented, and thoroughly tested application, ready for further development or presentation.
