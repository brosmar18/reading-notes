# Spots (Backend Development)

## Summary of Idea

Spots, a backend application designed for both travel enthusiasts and locals, focuses on enriching the experience of exploring new places. The goal is to use a user's location to offer personalized recommendations for local events, restaurants, and tourists experiences. Built with Express, MongoDB, and socket.io, Spots aims to simplify the discovery of local attractions and activities, addressing the common challenge of quickly finding enjoyable and relevant experiences in a new area or even familiar surroundings.


## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition
The MVP for Spots' backend includes:

1. **User Authentication and Role-Based Access Control**: Utilizing bcrypt and JWT for secure user logins and admin management.
2. **Real-Time User Interaction**: Providing a platform for users to engage in group chats, private messages, and interactions with others nearby through Socket.io.
3. **Efficient Backend Structure**: Featuring organized models, routes, and middleware on an Express server for effective data management and user interactions.
4. **Backend Testing and Visualization**: Implementing comprehensive testing using Jest and Supertest, with server actions visualized in the terminal, ready for future UI integration.

This MVP is the minimum required to demonstrate Spots on demo day, showcasing its core functionalities and backend capabilities.
