# Node.js

## Why It Matters
Node.js is a crucial technology in the current landscape of web development. As software increasingly moves to the cloud and becomes more interactive, having a technology that allows for real-time, fast, and scalable network aplications is vital. Node.js serves this purpose by allowing JS to run on the server-side, effectively marrying client-side and server-side development into a cohesive whole. 

## Reading Questions
1. **How would you describe Node to a non-technical friend?**

Node is like the backstage crew for a theater production. Usually, your web browser is the stage where everything happens--you see videos, read articles, and interact with websites. However, a lot happens behind the scenes to make sure you have a seamless experience, like storing data, sending messages, and updating content in real time. Node takes care of those backstage tasks, and it's special because it uses the same "language" (JS) that's used to script the action on the "stage" (the browser). This makes everything more efficient and harmonized. 

2. **What does it mean that Node is a JavaScript runtime?**

In technical terms, a "runtime" is like a stage where code performs its act. JavaScript was originally designed to perform on the stage of web browsers. Node allows JavaScript to perform on different stages, like servers, which are powerful computers that dish out websites and handle data. 

3. **What is Node used for?**

Node is used for a variety of tasks in web development, especially those that are I/O-intensive or real-time. It's great for things like chat apps, online gaming, and live updates on websites. It's also used for automating tasks and running various tools developers need. 

## Looking Ahead

- **Looking forward to Learning About:**

I am excited to learn about the asynchronous programming aspects of Node.js. I'm also looking forward to learning more about Express.js, the framework that works on top of Node.js

- **Learning goals after reading and reviewing the class README:**

My goal is to attain proficiency in the construction of server-side applications utilizing the Node.js runtime environment. I want to gain an understanding of the various components and operations that constitute the Node.js ecosystem, including how to write modular code using CommonJS modules.

Additionally, I look forward to learn about the process of importing and exporting modules as well as becoming proficient in writing tests to ensure the quality of my code. 

## Things I want to learn more about 
- What are the security best practices in a Node.js environment? 
- How do databases integrate with Node.js?
