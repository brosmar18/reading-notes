# Prep Your Mindset Review

## Summary of the Article: "Upgrade Your Technical Skills with Deliberate Practice"

### Why This Topic Matters
This topic is vital for anyone in technology, particularly in software development, where the landscape is constantly evolving. The concept of "deliberate practice" emphasizes that merely repeating tasks is not sufficient for improvement; a focused and strategic approach is required.

### Key Points
1. **Everyday Programming Doesn't Equate to Skill Improvement**: Just coding daily doesn't automatically improve your skills. Improvement needs focused, deliberate practice.
2. **Importance of Deliberate Practice**: Deliberate practice is a targeted and focused form of practice that pushes you just beyond your current capabilities.
3. **Challenges of a Comfort Zone**: Learning opportunities diminish as you become accustomed to solving similar problems.
4. **Components of Deliberate Practice**: It includes pushing beyond comfort zones, repeated practice, continuous feedback, mental demand, and clearly defined goals.
5. **Self-Taught Learning**: The onus of improvement lies on the individual in the tech field.
6. **Subjective Measures Are Difficult**: While technical correctness is easy to measure, assessing subjective qualities like code readability is challenging.

### Analogy from Previous Work Experience
In my previous role as an Emergency Technician at the ER, I mastered routine procedures, much like a programmer becomes proficient in common coding tasks. However, just as the ER sometimes presents rare or complex cases requiring different skills or quick adaptations, software development also has challenges that demand you step out of your comfort zone. These are the moments that genuinely contribute to skill improvement, similar to how tackling a rare medical case broadens your competence in emergency care.

- Are there any industry-standard deliberate practice techniques specifically tailored for software developers?


## The Power of Believing That You Can Improve

### Why This Topic Matters
The concept of a growth mindset—believing that one's abilities can be developed over time—has significant implications for personal and professional development. It changes the way we view failures, challenges, and our overall potential.

### Key Points
- Introducing the concept of "Not Yet" in grading can shift students away from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.
- Children who adopt a growth mindset engage more deeply in problems, are more resilient, and tend to improve academically.
- Praising the process rather than innate talent encourages a growth mindset.
- Mindsets can be taught and changed, improving academic performance across diverse student populations.

### Analogy From Previous Work Experience
In my previous role as an Emergency Technician at the ER, a growth mindset was essential. Every case presented a new set of challenges that we didn't always know how to solve immediately. Rather than seeing these challenges as failures, adopting a "not yet" attitude allowed us to see them as opportunities to grow and improve our medical techniques.

### Things I Want to Know More About
- How can organizations and institutions adopt the growth mindset culture effectively?
- What are the long-term effects of instilling a growth mindset in children?

## Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance

### Why This Topic Matters
Grit goes beyond mere talent and intelligence; it is a crucial determinant of success. This concept is increasingly gaining attention in educational and professional environments as a variable that can significantly influence outcomes.

### Key Points
- Grit is the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals.
- IQ and talent are poor predictors of grit.
- In various settings like West Point, National Spelling Bee, and Chicago public schools, grit emerged as a significant predictor of success.
- The science behind developing grit is not fully understood, but a "growth mindset" is seen as a contributing factor.

### Analogy From Previous Work Experience
Working as an Emergency Technician in an ER required a level of grit that is hard to overstate. Challenges occurred daily, and each shift could bring in situations where fast learning and prolonged focus were critical. There were no shortcuts; the "marathon, not a sprint" aspect of grit was a daily reality. A mere reliance on procedural knowledge or technical skills would have been inadequate.

### Things I Want to Know More About
- How can grit be effectively instilled in educational programs?
- What other factors can complement grit to contribute to overall success?
- How can companies measure grit during the recruitment process?

## Redefining Success and the Philosophy of Work

### Why This Topic Matters
Understanding the concept of success and how it impacts our lives is crucial. As Alain de Botton points out, society's current definitions of success and failure can lead to unnecessary stress and a loss of personal identity. This topic aims to prompt us to reconsider our values and assumptions about work, success, and the purpose of life.

### Key Points

1. **Humor in Headlines**: De Botton engages inmates with classic literary works, showing how different perspectives can yield humorous yet astute summaries of these stories.
  
2. **Self-Worship and Anxiety**: He talks about how modern society, by focusing only on human achievements, misses out on a broader, less egocentric perspective, contributing to anxiety and a loss of meaning.
  
3. **Redefining Success**: He suggests that societal definitions of success are often external, and not what individuals truly value. 

4. **Challenging Ideas of Success**: De Botton concludes by urging people to question and understand their own, personalized metrics for success.

### Analogy from Previous Work Experience
In my role as a Senior Disability Representative at Sedgwick Claims Management Services, the metric of success often revolved around processing claims efficiently and accurately, as well as adhering to the specifics of each disability plan. While these are critical aspects of the job, they don't fully encapsulate what it means to be successful in the role. As I evaluated complex medical information and coordinated investigative efforts, I realized that metrics like empathy, understanding the human element behind each claim, and ethical conduct were not directly measured but were crucial for truly successful outcomes. Alain de Botton's talk emphasizes this holistic approach to success that goes beyond mere efficiency and accuracy.


### Things I Want To Know More About
1. How can organizations implement De Botton's philosophies in practical terms?
2. What are some exercises or methodologies for identifying one's personal definition of success?
3. How can the element of randomness and 'haphazardness' that De Botton talks about be more widely acknowledged in society?


## Assessing emotional Intelligence 

The "Self-Awareness" score was 22 out of 25;it shows that my efforts to understand myself are paying off. However, my "Self-Management" score of 16 points to an area where I could use some improvement, particularly when it comes to staying composed and making decisions. I'm encouraged by my strong "Social Awareness" score of 21; it's good to know I can read people well and respond to their non-verbal cues. My "Relationship Management" score of 19 is solid but suggests there might be room for growth in how I manage conflicts or persuade others. Overall, I'm glad to see my emotional intelligence is generally strong, but the results have given me insights into specific areas where I can focus my personal development. 

## Assessing Self-Bias

Based on my bias-assessment, I found that I scored quite well in "Empathy and Curiosity," reflecting my willingness to engage with uncomfortable topics and try to understand other perspectives. However, my score in "Bias and the Brain" indicates room for improvement, particularly in how I make quick decisions without considering potential biases. It's reassuring to see my strength in "Meaningful Connections," where I tend to value dissenting opinions and seek to diversify my circle of influence. I was surprised to find that I need to work on "Effective Courage"; I thought I was more outspoken when it comes to confronting biases, but it appears I might be holding back. Overall, my score falls in the 75-99 range, suggesting I've made some progress but still have work to do, particularly in slowing down my decision-making process to consider potential biases.
