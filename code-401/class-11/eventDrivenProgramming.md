# Event Driven Programming

## Reading 

1. What native Node.js module allows us to get started with Event Driven Programming?

    The native Node.js module that enables the initiation of Event-Driven Programming is `EventEmitter`. This module is a crucial part of the Node.js 'events' package and provides a straightforward way to implement event-driven architecture in Node.js apps. It allows developers to create, listen to, and handlecustom events in an efficient manner. The EventEmitter class is designed to handle asynchronous event-driven programming, making it easier ot manage complex operations workflows in Node.js projects. 

2. What is the value of Object Oriented Programming used in tandem with Event Driven Programming?

    Combining OOP wth EDP creates a powerful synergy for complex app development. OOP focuses on encapsulating data and behavior within objects, promoting modularity and reusability. When integrated with EDP, it allows these objects to communicate through events rather than direct method calls. This combination enhances the scalability and maintainability of applications. It enables a more decoupled architecture where objects react to events independently, leadning to cleaner, more organized code that is easier to debug and extend. 


3. Consider your knowledge of Event Driven Programming in the Web Browser, now explain to a non-technical friend how Event Driven Programming might be useful on the backend using Node.js.

    Imagine you're at a party, and you're waiting for something interesting to happen. In Event-Driven Programming, the program acts like you at the party. It waits and listens for specific events (like someone arriving at the party or music starting) and then reacts o them (like greeting the newcomer or dancing to the music). This is useful because the program doesn't have to constantly check if something has happened; it jsut responds when it does. This makes programs more efficient, especially for things like chat applications or live updates, where actions happen based on user interactions or other triggers. 

## Looking Ahead

1. What do you look forward to learning? 

    I look forward to learning about event-driven programming and how I can implement events in OOP. I want to understand how to raise and monitor events, and how to effectively respond to these events in my code. I particularly look forward to exploring the practiacl application of the Observer pattern and th development of modular, event-based systems. 

2. Things I want to know more about? 

    I want to learn more about the intricacies of th Node.js system and how it enhances JavaScripts event handilng capabilities. I want to see real-world examples of event-driven programming, such as how events are integrated into user interfaces, server routes, and frameworks like React.
