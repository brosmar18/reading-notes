# Project Ideas

## Idea 1: Family Hub App

### Overview
The Family Hub App is designed as a comprehensive solution for managing the daily organizational needs of a household. It serves as a centralized platform where family members can efficiently manage tasks, calendar events, grocery lists, pending home projects, bills, and more. Its core objective is to streamline the process of organizing and tracking daily activities and responsibilities, fostering a more harmonious and coordinated family life. 

### Technical Implementation
- **API Auth Server Deployment:** Built upon a robust API Auth server for secure and reliable deployment.
- **Database Operations:** Powered by a well-structured API server, facilitating seamless database operations including CRUD functionalities for tasks, events, shopping lists, and bill payments.
- **Access Control:** Each family member will have unique login credentials, with an authentication system providing security and privacy. Utilizes ACL (Access Control List) to control access to sensitive information.

### Presentation Plan
I will demonstrate the Family Hub's general functionality, including its user-friendly interface for easy addition, editing, and tracking of various household activities. A quick overview of the system's wiring will be provided, along with a detailed code review to showcase the code's robustness and adherence to best practices. The Family Hub Application is not only aligned with the project's learning objectives but also promises to be a practical tool for families.

## Idea 2: Time Bank - A Community Skill Exchange Platform

### Overview
Time Bank is an innovative application designed to revolutionize how individuals exchange skills and services within their communities. Using time as the currency, it allows users to trade services based on time spent, fostering community engagement and promoting the sharing of diverse skills and talents.

### Meeting the Assignment Requirements
- **API Auth Server Deployment:** Developed on a robust API Auth server for secure and reliable deployment.
